### Sorting Algorithms Repository
This repository contains an implementation of six sorting algorithms: Insertion sort, Bubble sort, Selection Sort, Merge sort, Quick sort, and Heap sort. The implementation is done in the Java programming language.

## Purpose
In addition to implementing the algorithms, the purpose of this work is to compare the efficiency of each algorithm with one another. The results can be found in the sortingResults.txt file as well as in the accompanying Excel file.

## Algorithms Implemented
* Insertion sort
* Bubble sort
* Selection sort
* Merge sort
* Quick sort
* Heap sort

Feel free to explore the repository and use the provided implementations for your projects. Contributions and suggestions are welcome.
